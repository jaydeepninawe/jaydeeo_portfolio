            ðŸ‘‹ Hey there! I'm a 3rd-year B.Tech student specializing in
            Information Technology, passionate about building real-world tech
            solutions and exploring the depths of core computer science.
            <br />
            Iâ€™m currently diving deep into the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express,
            React, Node.js) and enhancing my deployment skills using Docker,
            Jenkins, and AWS. With hands-on experience in CI/CD pipelines, Iâ€™m
            learning how to ship reliable and scalable applications.
